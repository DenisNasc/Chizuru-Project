# 千鶴 (Chizuru) Project

## About

This project is for my TCC (I don't know how its called in english 😢).

My goal its to create an web app, especifically an PWA, with **ReactJS** in frontend and **Django Rest Framework** in backend.

This PWA should receive an quota table of any ship, return its hydrostatics curves, and make some AWESOME structural calculus, based on the loads that will be possible to insert.
